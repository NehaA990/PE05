# Input
The program accepts input through a user-friendly web interface where users can add, edit, view, and delete recipes. Users provide input through form fields, including the recipe name, ingredients, and detailed step-by-step instructions. Input is validated both on the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid submissions.

# Process
When a user interacts with the interface, the frontend (built using React) triggers API requests to the backend server (implemented with Express.js). The backend handles the requests through defined routes, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations, which interact with the MongoDB database. The server processes the input by adding new recipes, updating existing ones, fetching recipe data, or deleting recipes from the database. Error handling mechanisms are in place to manage invalid data or failed operations, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

# Output
The program dynamically displays the output on the frontend, showcasing a list of recipes with their details. Users can view a specific recipe, see updates instantly, and receive feedback messages such as success notifications or error alerts. The output is designed to be responsive and visually clear, enhancing user experience and ensuring the application's functionality is transparent and accessible.
